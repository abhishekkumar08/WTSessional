              <b><i>As an engineering student, the one thing that you can hopefully hope for is a good campus life. And kiit delivers on that front. The campus life at kiit is one of the most endearing aspects of the college. It rightfully boasts of a beautiful campus as long as you do not get in the way of the authorities.
                Amidst lush greenery and fancy footpaths, KIIT offers you evenings that you would most likely never forget. Within a few kilometres from the sea coast, the evening breeze after the sweltering afternoon Sun can be the best part of your day. The canteens are good, offer tasty food besides serving as an excellent spot to hangout. Hostels are comfortable, except the mess. You would be wasting your mess fee for all of those four years that you stay there, and there is really nothing that you can do about it, unless you opt not to live in the hostel.
                                <br> Restrictions are there in the first year. Entry timings are strictly imposed for both boys and girls. From second year onwards, the rules are relaxed for boys, but they are still strictly imposed for girls. <br> Smoking and drinking is a norm and would happen around you in the boys' hostel unless they get caught. Hefty fines are imposed for offences as grave as alcohol consumption and as little as missing your classes. Though the latter happens only on surprise inspections. Basically there is price to be paid for every illegal luxury that you avail. So break the rules of you want to, but don't get caught.
                                There are no restrictions on opposite gender interaction unless of course you're found snogging in public, which often happens. The locals and the staff might give you a disgusted look at times, even when you're quietly hanging out, but that's none of your business. <br>
                                What else? Classes are air conditioned and so are the reading rooms and libraries. So there is comfort for the studious ones as well. Labs are really good, no matter which department you belong to. Classes are bunked often. The KIIT road would be your daily recreational park.
                                In short, KIIT has got the luxuries for the luxurious and serenity for the simple. It is an entire world in itself and you're a tiny little part of it.</i>
